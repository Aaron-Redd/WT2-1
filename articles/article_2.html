	<p id="parag">While most tech advancements help us move towards the greater good, some aren’t as beneficial as we might think.

	<p id="parag">Chatbots are a program to respond to certain queries in certain ways and are designed to help customers with some of the more basic functions that they would need. These are, of course, still not in a position wherein they are a complete substitute for real live customer service, which is what has helped them still stay in development.</p>
